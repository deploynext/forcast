        Your trust matters to us. At <strong>Fiscal Fusion</strong>, weâ€™re not
        in the business of collecting or selling personal data. We run a news
        site, not an ad-tech company. This policy explains, in plain language,
        what information we do collect, how we use it, and how you stay in
        control.
      </p>

      {/* --- Info Section --- */}
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Information we collect</h2>
        <p>
          When you visit our site, a few basic details are automatically shared
          with us through standard web toolsâ€”things like your browser type,
          device, and general location. This helps us understand how people are
          reading our stories and where we can improve the site.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          If you choose to sign up for newsletters or contact us directly,
          weâ€™ll also have the information you shareâ€”like your name, email
          address, or the contents of your message. Thatâ€™s it. We donâ€™t ask for
          anything we donâ€™t need.
        </p>

      {/* --- Usage Section --- */}
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">How we use it</h2>
        <p>The information we collect is used only to:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>Improve site performance and reader experience</li>
          <li>Respond to questions, tips, or corrections you send us</li>
          <li>Send newsletters or updates youâ€™ve asked to receive</li>
        </ul>

          We never sell your information to third parties. <strong>Period.</strong>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Cookies and analytics</h2>
        <p>
          Like most websites, we use cookies and analytics tools to see how the
          site is being used. This helps us figure out what stories people are
          reading, how long theyâ€™re staying, and what we can do better. You can
          control cookies through your browser settings at any time.

        <p>
          Some of our content may include links to outside sites or embedded
          media (like videos, charts, or social posts). If you click through to
          another site, their privacy practices applyâ€”not ours. We only link to
          sources we trust, but we encourage you to read their policies too.

        <p>
          We take reasonable steps to keep any information you share with us
          secure. While no system is perfect, we use industry-standard measures
          to protect against unauthorized access.
